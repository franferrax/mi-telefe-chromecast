Una página sencilla para poder ver el contenido de Mi Telefé en el Chromecast (con *JW Player*)

This page was made just to overcome a particular site limitation in its *JW Player* usage (it does not allow to cast the content).

I think that someone might found it interesting the way in which it uses https://helloacm.com/curl and https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com to achive all its work in the browser with *Javascript*.
